FAQ
---
1.)	What is this?
	->	This is a tool to gather information from SC2's memory and draw overlays to display those information
		You gain a big advantage if used properly.
		As Blizzard defines, it's a 3rd party tool therefore it's forbidden to use.
		Using this tool can result in a ban from the Blizzard service "Starcraft II".
		
		_USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK_

2.)	Why would you do it?
	->	I'm just curious what can and can not be done. I like the interaction with SCII and the drawing/ formatting of the data.
		Additionally, I want to exploit the way SCII is designed. SCII send *all* data to all clients.
		Maphacks are possible. Such models are totally outdated and should not be used anymore.
		
3.)	What about fairplay?
	->	Since *it is* possible to do the things I do, there can't be a 100% of fairplay. There will always be another person 
		to publish hacks similar to this. The lack of fairplay is Blizzard's fault.
